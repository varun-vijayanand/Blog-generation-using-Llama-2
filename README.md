# Blog-generation-using-Llama-2

Here I have developed a blog generation app using Llama 2 LLM, generating content based on user inputs such as blog title, word count, and intended audience.
The user interface has been designed with Streamlit for an intuitive user experience.
Also leveraged LangChain for context management, prompt engineering, and seamless integration with content tools.
